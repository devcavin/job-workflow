# SafariShule (School Trip)

## Pain Point
Parents want to know exactly when the bus enters their estate so they can walk to the gate. They don't want to wait in the rain or sunshine for 20 minutes.

### Problem
Processing GPS coordinates from 20 buses every second and matching them against 500 different "Home Zones" is expensive for a database
  
### Solution
A Real-Time Geospatial Event Engine
